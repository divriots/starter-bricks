# BRICKS Starter Kit

BRICKS is a Design System Starter Kit based on [MUI](https://mui.com/):

> a simple and customizable component library to build faster, beautiful,
> and more accessible React applications

It configures _MUI_ with sensible defaults, makes it ready for your extensions
where needed, and lays a foundation for your future documentation.

## Features

- ‚ôªÔ∏è Open source
- üî• ~50 components in 7 categories
- üé® Tokens-based theming system
- üß± MUI's compatible theme generated with `createTheme`
- üìñ MUI's components documentation embedded
- üìö Interactive documentation
- üåó Dark mode support

### Design Tokens

BRICKS takes the Design Tokens as in [MUI Theme Configuration Variables](https://mui.com/customization/theming/#theme-configuration-variables)
as well as advanced ones:

- [Colors](../../colors/doc/colors)
- [Fonts](../../fonts/doc/fonts)
- [Spacing](../../spacing/doc/spacing)
- [Breakpoints](../../breakpoints/doc/breakpoints)
- [Z-Indexes](../../z-index/doc/z-index)

and make them automatically documented and visually discoverable.

### Components

BRICKS comes with +40 components to get started, in 7 categories:
`Inputs`, `Data-display`, `Feedback`, `Surfaces`, `Navigation`, `Layout`, and `Date/Time`.
Everything to cover the basics, and more.

and sign up or log in if you already have an account.
Make sure you have a workspace, then go to the
[Backlight starter-kits list](https://backlight.dev/starter-kits) and click

## Documentation

### Design System Documentation

_BRICKS_ is shipped with a good documentation basis which starts in this
[introduction](https://backlight.dev/doc/k0DvZztNuwmS6XnXoohE/introduction/doc/index.mdx)
and then walks you through the usage of tokens and components.
Just open it and start exploring!

### Backlight Documentation

We created [DS Mastery](https://backlight.dev/mastery/) to help you become a hero in
the design system development.

To learn about Backlight features there is an
[official documentation](https://backlight.dev/docs/) too.
